# Saliency maps
   We provide saliency maps and [measure results (.mat)](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1l4GPBcPYCO9atbgDwbkfUw) (code: i9d0) of [all compared methods](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1TP6An1VWygGUy4uvojL0bg) (code: 5np3) and [our MCCNet](https://pan.baidu.com/s/10JIKL2Q48RvBGeT2pmPfDA) (code: 3pvq) on ORSSD and EORSSD datasets.
   
   In addition, we also provide [saliency maps of our MCCNet](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1dz-GeELIqMdzKlPvzETixA) (code: 413m) on the recently published [ORSI-4199](https://github.com/wchao1213/ORSI-SOD) dataset.
