# ESGNet
This project provides the code and results for 'Edge and Skeleton Guidance Network for Salient
Object Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Images'（DOI：10.1109/TCSVT.2023.3275252）.
# Saliency maps
   We provide saliency maps of our ESGNet (https://pan.baidu.com/s/1sbE3opb-vJ_QCVccbeQhNw) (code:hust ) on ORSSD and EORSSD datasets.
   
   In addition, we also provide saliency maps (https://pan.baidu.com/s/1UnoS1k-REKuVIWEgtPmSXQ) (code:hust) on the recently published [ORSI-4199](https://github.com/wchao1213/ORSI-SOD) dataset.
  
# Evaluation Tool
  You can use the evaluation tool (MATLAB version)](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1aGruaJAtKJnWN5qDx1jZnQ) (code:hust) to evaluate the above saliency maps.
